# task-3

Overview
This project solves a regression problem for predicting house prices using the provided Housing dataset and the Scikit-learn linear regression toolkit. The workflow mirrors best practices from top Kaggle solutions: clean data preprocessing, effective feature engineering, and careful model evaluation.

Objectives
Load, clean, and preprocess the house prices data.
Encode categorical features and engineer meaningful variables.
Build and evaluate simple and multiple linear regression models.
Interpret coefficients and model precision using regression metrics.
Visualize actual vs predicted results and share key learnings.

Dataset
Source: Housing.csv

Features: Includes area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, furnishingstatus, and target column price.

Steps Performed

1. Data Preparation
Loaded dataset with pandas and checked for missing values and data types.
Encoded categorical variables (yes/no, furnishingstatus) using numeric codes and one-hot encoding.
Engineered new features (e.g., total floor area, etc. if needed).

2. Splitting Data
Used an 80/20 train-test split to ensure unbiased model validation.

3. Model Training
Implemented linear regression using scikit-learn.
Both simple regression (single feature) and multiple regression (all features) were explored.
Log-transform of price used if needed for variance stabilization.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
Visualized true vs predicted house prices with scatterplots.
Inspected model coefficients and intercept for interpretation.

5. Results & Interpretation
Outlined which features most strongly influence house price.
Highlighted patterns, outliers, and explained error metrics.

6. Advanced Insights (Kaggle-inspired)
Emphasized robust encoding and outlier handling as in top Kaggle solutions.
Documented possible improvements: ensembling, feature selection, and cross-validation.
